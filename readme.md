# Michael's Python Examples

Test status: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/michaelcoyote/python_examples.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/michaelcoyote/python_examples)

This is a basic repo for the python things I've come across and lessons 
I've learned.  I'm going back through now and adding some tests to keep
myself honest.

Most things here should be in standard python format and often implemented
as classes within their files.  While some of this code is fairly robust,
it may not all be production ready. Use with caution.
