# Michael's Code Examples

Test status: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/michaelcoyote/code_examples.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/michaelcoyote/code_examples)

This is a basic repo for the code things I've come across and lessons 
I've learned.  I'm going back through now and adding some tests to keep
myself honest.

Most of this is Python with some Javascript/Typescript and Rust
Python code will generally be implemented as classes within their files.
These are rough examples. Use with caution.
